These two folders contains the sourcecode for all of the final project PEGN 624

Within Compositional:
-This was the original program I made. It doesn't require fancy libraries or anything to run. Just Python 2.7 and a computer with Python
-The only library required is NumPy to solve cubic roots.
-This program will not generate Ternary Diagrams

Within NumCompositional:
-This was the modified version of the compositional program. It should be far more efficient with more complex compositions.
-This program can generate Ternary Diagrams with the correct libraries
--Installing these libraries can be difficult. If you need help downloading/running these libraries let me know and I can help.

The schema for both folders/programs is the almost identical:
All files with extension '.py' are Python 2.7 files. Multiple IDE's were used in this code's creation.
CompModel - Runs a basic compositional model at a given composition, temperature, and pressure
TernaryModel - Generates a ternary diagram -- NumCompositional only!
Flash - Contains the flash algorithm to flash composition mixtures.
Mixture - Contains all mixture variables and Z-Factor calculations
Fluid - Contains properties for fluids within mixtures -- Compositional only (not NumCompositional)
Helper - A helper extension to do simple math functions and anything tedious

Due to BIC values the program will only work for the given mixture of C1, C4, C10.
